/* Function: Main
 * Description: This function will iterate through different routes (using
 * the Switch component) and render the corresponding components.
 *
 * The Route component is where I can pass in the component to render. If the
 * path matches, then the corresponding component is rendered.
 * Routes can render 3 things: component, render, children
 *
 * The route for the homepage includes an exact prop. This is used to state
 * that the route should only match when the pathname matches the routeâ€™s
 * path exactly.
